# Deployment & Performance

## Performance Targets (from PRD)

| Metric              | Target                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Frame rate          | 60 FPS during pan, zoom, manipulation |
| Object sync latency | <100ms (Ably broadcast)               |
| Cursor sync latency | <50ms (Ably broadcast)                |
| Object capacity     | 500+ objects without drops            |
| Concurrent users    | 5+ without degradation                |
| AI response latency | <2 seconds for single-step commands   |

## Environment Variables (Vercel Dashboard)

```bash
# Client-side (VITE_ prefix = exposed to browser)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxx.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxx
VITE_ABLY_API_KEY=xxx

# Server-side only (Vercel serverless functions)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx

# Optional
VITE_ENABLE_METRICS=true
SENTRY_DSN=xxx
```

Never expose `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the client. AI calls route through `/api/ai/generate.js`.

## Deployment (Vercel)

- Auto-deploy on `git push origin main`.
- Frontend: static React build served via Vercel edge CDN.
- Serverless: `/api` folder auto-deployed as Vercel functions.
- No custom backend server to manage.
