# AI Usage Snapshot Artifacts

This folder stores generated usage/cost snapshot artifacts from:

`npm run usage:collect`

Generated files:

1. `usage-snapshot-*.json` — raw collector response (provider summaries + totals + storage metadata)
2. `usage-snapshot-*.md` — human-readable summary for submission evidence

Use these artifacts to replace estimated values in:

`/Users/youss/Development/gauntlet/collab-board/docs/submission/ai-cost-analysis.md`
